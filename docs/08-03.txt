What did I do since yesterday?
  Added a class for constants. Implemented signUp() and logIn(). Updated CustomerSignUpScreen and CustomerLogInScreen to execute signUp() and logIn(). Added an interface for notifying the main thread when reading data is completed.

  Finish User and Customer classes. Regex check for username and password. VenueReader? (I will probably need this in User)
